# Fantasy Football Project
CSCI 2270 Final Project

**Summary**

This project will use an extensive list of Fantasy Football data online in CSV format.  It will read the data from the file into either a Binary Search Tree, Red Black Tree, or Hash Table (not quite sure which we want to work with yet).  The program will allow for a number of functions to analyze the data, such as pull the top entered number of results or bottom entered number of results by certain criterias.  It will also allow for the data to be sorted in ascending/descending order depending on user preference.
